# **Overview**
This guess my number game is to help me navigate my journey through the land of JavaScript. It help me solidify my understanding in `logical operators`and `Math.random()` functions. To make the game fun I, the player has 5 attempts to guess the random number. Failure to do so, you'll lose the game. If you guess it correctly you win. The `guess button` checks if the typed number equals the hidden number and `reset button` restarts the game.
